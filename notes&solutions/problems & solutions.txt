Problems:
1. Hero Container Nesting became complex 
2.Like,share & comment Button size & padding problems unresponsive.
3.My resolution is 1920 x 1080 so that the problems araised!
4.Music Studio Images searching as usual.
5.Background Image need to be removed,Images's bg must be removed in order to intersect the two boxes.
6.left side clip and right side description I was not able to overlap the clip path with headings.
7.Responsive with the main box.
8.Padding,margin,font-size probelmatic for smaller screen as always.



Solutions:
1.Updated more div to each components and applied display flex with @mixins
2.As usual media queries added with width = 100% max-width: 1550px ie.max desktop size.
3.https://www.remove.bg/ used this site to remove the bg of image.
4.Although I knew the property of z-index but this was the shinning and real time to show I used z-index to overlap the clip path and show the descriptions.
5.solved by decreasing width & height with media queries.
